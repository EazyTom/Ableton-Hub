- ✅ Search modes (name, export name, tags, notes)
- ✅ Real-time debounced search results
- ✅ Always-visible tempo filter with preset ranges

#### Project Similarity & Discovery
- ✅ Jaccard similarity algorithm for plugin and device overlap
- ✅ Multi-metric comparison (plugins, devices, tempo, structure, feature vectors)
- ✅ Weighted similarity scoring (0-100%)
- ✅ Similar projects in Project Details Dialog
- ✅ "Find Similar Projects" context menu option
- ✅ Recommendations Panel with similarity-based suggestions
- ✅ Smart Collections similarity filter rule
- ✅ Visual similarity indicators on project cards

#### ML/AI Infrastructure (Phase 5)
- ✅ Enhanced ALS parser with extended metadata extraction (device chains, clips, routing, automation)
- ✅ ASD clip file parser for warp markers, transients, and timing data
- ✅ ML Feature Extraction service combining ALS metadata with audio analysis (librosa)
- ✅ Project Similarity Analyzer using cosine similarity, Jaccard similarity, weighted metrics
- ✅ ML Clustering Service (K-means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical) for project grouping
- ✅ Recommendation Engine for similar projects, plugin suggestions, auto-tagging

#### Export Tracking
- ✅ Automatic export detection during project scanning
- ✅ Smart fuzzy matching for export-to-project linking (exact → normalized → fuzzy)
- ✅ Export metadata tracking (format, bit depth, sample rate, file size)
- ✅ Export-to-project mapping with confidence scoring
- ✅ Visual export status indicators (green border, 🔊 icon)
- ✅ Custom export song name for improved matching

#### Audio Preview & Playback
- ✅ Waveform thumbnail generation from exported audio
- ✅ Click-to-play on project cards (cycle through multiple exports)
- ✅ Status bar playback display with filename
- ✅ In-app audio playback with full transport controls
- ✅ Support for WAV, AIFF, MP3, FLAC, OGG, M4A formats
- ✅ Volume control and seek slider

#### Duplicate Detection
- ✅ Hash-based duplicate detection (SHA256)
- ✅ Name-based similarity matching (85% threshold)
- ✅ Location-based detection (same name in different locations)
- ✅ Duplicate reports in Health Dashboard

#### Backup & Archive
- ✅ Configurable backup location in sidebar
- ✅ Project backups view in Project Properties dialog
- ✅ Backup project launch (double-click to open in Live)
- ✅ Automatic backup detection in Backup folders
- ✅ Archive service for compressed (ZIP) project backups
- ✅ One-click archive to backup location
- ✅ Backup .als files excluded from main project grid

#### Location Management
- ✅ Multiple location types (local, network, cloud, USB, custom)
- ✅ Favorite locations with color coding
- ✅ Active/inactive status with project counts
- ✅ Last scan timestamp tracking
- ✅ Bulk scan all active locations

#### Tagging System
- ✅ Flexible tagging with categories
- ✅ Color-coded tags for visual organization
- ✅ Full CRUD operations for tags
- ✅ Tag-based filtering

#### Ableton Live Integration
- ✅ Automatic Live version detection (9.x, 10.x, 11.x, 12.x)
- ✅ Live launcher with version selection
- ✅ Quick launch (double-click projects)
- ✅ Preferences folder access per Live version
- ✅ Options.txt editing/creation

#### Ableton Link Network
- ✅ Link device discovery and monitoring
- ✅ Real-time Link network status
- ✅ Device information display (name, IP address)

#### User Interface
- ✅ Multiple themes (Orange, Cool Blue, Green, Rainbow)
- ✅ Grid and list views with toggle
- ✅ Sortable list view (Name, Location, Tempo, Key, Version, Modified, etc.)
- ✅ Rainbow tempo colors on project cards
- ✅ MCP servers integration links in sidebar
- ✅ Learning resources links (Ableton docs, trainers, user groups)
